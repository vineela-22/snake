# Snakes and Ladders

## **Overview**
- Snakes and Ladders is a quite simple racing board game derived from the Indian game Pachisi. You probably have played it once or twice in your childhood. It is also known as 'Moksha-Patamu.'
- The goal of the game is to navigate your coin from start to finish, by avoiding the snakes, and taking shortcuts going up the ladders.
- The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes). The game is also sold under other names such as Chutes and Ladders, Bible Ups and Downs, etc., and a morality Chutes and Ladders was published by the Milton Bradley Company starting from 1943.
- The size of the grid varies, but is most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12 squares. Boards have snakes and ladders starting and ending on different squares; both factors affect the duration of play. Each player is represented by a distinct game piece token. A single die is rolled to determine random movement of a player's token in the traditional form of play; two dice may be used for a shorter game.

## **Gameplay**
- Each player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the "1" grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, off the board next to the "1" grid square). Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die rolled. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a boustrophedon (from right to left and from left to right in alternate lines.) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a "ladder", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a "snake", the token must be moved down to the snake's lower-numbered square.
- The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.
